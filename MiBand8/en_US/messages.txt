Focus
Focus helps you concentrate over a short period of time to work more efficiently.

A Focus session normally lasts for 25 minutes. Once you start, concentrate fully on your task until your device vibrates, at which point you can rest for 5 minutes.

 We recommend taking a 15-20 minute break after every 4 Focus sessions.

Your band notifies you when your heart rate goes above a set level while you're at rest. It's normal for your heart rate to rise as a response to stress, caffeine intake, or a cold. However, people experiencing dizziness, shortness of breath, or palpitations should seek medical advice. Note that the high heart rate data is not intended for medical purposes, nor is it intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or condition. The band only displays the 3 most recent high heart rate records. For more information, check the app.

Wear your band to bed to track sleep. You'll be able to view the 3 most recent sleep history records on your band. More detailed sleep history is available in the app on your phone. Turn on Advanced monitoring in Settings to track rapid eye movement and get more accurate sleep information. At least 3 hours of uninterrupted sleep will allow your band to record the average heart rate and blood oxygen. For shorter naps, only fall-asleep and wake-up times will be recorded. Naps lasting less than 20 minutes will not be recorded. Poor sleep quality and excessive wrist movement during sleep may cause inaccurate heart rate data and failure to measure blood oxygen.

Low SpO₂
1. SpO₂ represents the percentage of oxygen in your blood.

3. There are multiple factors that might make measurements inconsistent or unreliable. They might include skin perfusion, permanent or temporary changes to your skin, motion, or pose during sleep. All of the above might result in a falsely low blood oxygen alert. Remember that this is not a medical device, and the data it generates can't be used for diagnosis and treatment.

When your oxygen saturation level stays below the set value for a period of time, you'll receive an alert. Your band will display the 3 most recent records. View more in the app.
If you experience shortness of breath, headache, fatigue, or loss of concentration, seek professional medical attention.

VO₂ max is a key indicator of the body's aerobic capacity. The device will assess your athletic ability based on factors such as age, sex, and heart rate during exercise, and VO₂ max will change as your athletic ability improves.
Find your VO₂ max
1. Fill in your personal information in the app. 2. Wear the band and run outdoors for 10+ mins to reach 75% of your max heart rate.

Steps
Calories
Moving
Standing
"Steps" shows a daily step count. An active person walks between 8000 and 10,000 steps a day.
"Calories" shows the number of active calories burned through moving around and exercising.
"Moving" shows your time doing moderate and vigorous activity. Aim for at least 30 minutes per day, 5 times per week of moderate activity or 75 minutes a week of intense activity. You'll see your "Moving" progress when your cadence exceeds 100 SPM or your heart rate exceeds 65% of your max heart rate.
"Standing" shows hours in which you stand up and move around. Try to stand up and move during 12 different hours in the day.

Your Vitality score is calculated using heart rate and activity data. Allow your band to measure your heart rate more often for a more accurate Vitality score.
Learn more
Vitality score is a way of measuring the impact of your workouts on your health. For best health outcomes, try to reach 100 points over a 7-day period.
Vitality scores are based on the recommendations of the WHO guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behavior.
That is, adults should engage in 150-300 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75-150 minutes of high-intensity aerobic activity per week, or a combination of the two, for maximum health benefits.
Any physical activity, including low-intensity activity, is better for your health than staying sedentary.

When you wear your band to bed, it will automatically record information about your sleep. The device will display the latest 3 records; you can view more detailed information in the app.
Turn on Advanced monitoring in Settings to get more accurate sleep information, such as recognizing REM sleep.
When you sleep for more than 3 hours, your device will display your average heart rate, SpO₂ level, and sleep score. For naps under 3 hours, only the time you fall asleep and wake up will be displayed. Naps under 20 minutes won't be recorded.
Poor sleep quality and excessive movement during sleep may cause inaccurate heart rate and SpO₂ measurements.
